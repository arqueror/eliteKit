# Documentation
  - This is an In Progress task in which i will be working on a daily basis. New logic (solving bugs, new features, etc) is being added while i'm writting the docs for each item so probably NuGet won't be updated until i finish with this task (please be patient).You can check the progress at https://arqueror.github.io/eliteKit/
