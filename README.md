SkiaSharp based components for .Net. 

# Motivation
  - Create reusable and beautiful controls using SkiaSharp. This is a community effort so all PR's are welcome.
  
# Supported Platforms
  - Currently it is only available for Xamarin.Forms (iOS, Android and UWP) but more platforms will be added.
  
# Documentation
  - This is an In Progress task in which i will be working on a daily basis. New logic (solving bugs, new features, etc) is being added while i'm writting the docs for each item so probably NuGet won't be updated until i finish with this task (please be patient).You can check the progress at https://arqueror.github.io/eliteKit/
